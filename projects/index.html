a web-based application that combines physical activity and gaming for a fun,

this project turns your movements into game controls, allowing you to play Tetris while staying active! With 800+ hackers participating in the uOttahack 7 hackathon,
this project got First Place in NAV CANADA’s challenge

• Split data parsed from a CSV and stored it as a dataframe, which is then split in to X(independent variables) and y(dependent variable) datasets.
The X and y datasets are then split into X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test by using the Scikit-Learn library
and a 80:20(train to test ratio, this ensures that 80% of the data parsed from the CSV file is allocated to training the model
and the other 20% is used to test the model to see how accurate its predictions are, this ratio can change based on the size of the datasets).
• Used Scikit-Learn to train different Simple/Multiple linear regression, polynomial regression, support vector regression,
decision tree regression, and random forest regression models to predict salaries based on someone’s previous position in a company.
• Used Scikit-Learn to train a logistic regression and K-nearest neighbors based classification models to classify whether someone with a certain age and salary would purchase a car.
• Plotted test and training data with respect to predicted/real values with Plotly, and Matplotlib.
• I have also performed the above data analysis using R and its respective libraries.</p></div><button data-accent-color="" type="button" aria-haspopup="dialog" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="radix-:R4haul6:" data-state="closed" class="rt-reset rt-BaseButton rt-r-size-2 rt-variant-solid rt-Button">View More</button></div><div class="rt-Flex rt-r-fd-column rt-r-ai-start rt-r-gap-2 rx-Stack css-1ed39m3"><p class="rt-Text css-1orcz">2024</p><h1 class="rt-Heading rt-r-size-6 css-1dcq27k">A Basic Computer</h1><div class="css-gr7s7g"><p class="rt-Text css-56tzch">• Used an FPGA for this project.
• Developed the ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) of the basic computer so that it would be able to perform simple addition,
subtraction, multiplication by 2, and perform logical operations like “AND”.
• Developed a controller for the basic computer which would be able to detect the set flags in the basic computer, for
example, to check if the assembly instruction CMA (Compliment the value in the accumulator) is called then the controller
would check the instruction cycle the computer is currently in and the first few bits of the instruction register. Then the
values from the controller goes into a control register which makes sure that they are outputted in synchronous manner by
utilizing positive edge triggered D-FF(flip flops) that are all connected to the same clock.</p></div><button data-accent-color="" type="button" aria-haspopup="dialog" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="radix-:R4hqul6:" data-state="closed" class="rt-reset rt-BaseButton rt-r-size-2 rt-variant-solid rt-Button">View More</button></div><div class="rt-Flex rt-r-fd-column rt-r-ai-start rt-r-gap-2 rx-Stack css-1ed39m3"><p class="rt-Text css-1orcz">2024</p><h1 class="rt-Heading rt-r-size-6 css-1dcq27k">Rentify</h1><div class="css-gr7s7g"><p class="rt-Text css-56tzch">Worked in a team to develop an Android app.
• The goal of the app is to connect people who want to rent out their belongings with people who are looking to rent. The app
supports item listing, searching, and renting, creating an easy-to-use service for both parties.
• The app uses SQL as the backend to facilitate the interactions between the renters and lessor accounts.
• I had a flexible role during this project where I mainly worked on the front end of the app where I made sure to make a
UI/UX experience that would be easy to understand and follow. I also worked on backend fixes as needed for the app, for
example debugging/fixing SQL queries as needed.
• Also did QA (Quality assurance) testing of the app to ensure high quality of the code.</p></div><button data-accent-color="" type="button" aria-haspopup="dialog" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="radix-:R4iaul6:" data-state="closed" class="rt-reset rt-BaseButton rt-r-size-2 rt-variant-solid rt-Button">View More</button></div><div class="rt-Flex rt-r-fd-column rt-r-ai-start rt-r-gap-2 rx-Stack css-1ed39m3"><p class="rt-Text css-1orcz">2024</p><h1 class="rt-Heading rt-r-size-6 css-1dcq27k">MindScribeAI (Hack the Hill II)</h1><div class="css-gr7s7g"><p class="rt-Text css-56tzch">• Developed an AI-powered journaling app using Flask for the backend and React for the frontend.
• The application has a feature that allows the user to generate monthly reports based on their previously written journals, this
functionality was achieved by using Gemini 1.5 Flash as it is quick to respond to / generate text.
• Gemini was also used as a chatbot in the app but was prompt engineered so that it would talk like a therapist.

journals as well as authenticating users.</p></div><button data-accent-color="" type="button" aria-haspopup="dialog" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="radix-:R4iqul6:" data-state="closed" class="rt-reset rt-BaseButton rt-r-size-2 rt-variant-solid rt-Button">View More</button></div><div class="rt-Flex rt-r-fd-column rt-r-ai-start rt-r-gap-2 rx-Stack css-1ed39m3"><p class="rt-Text css-1orcz">2024</p><h1 class="rt-Heading rt-r-size-6 css-1dcq27k">Python Projects</h1><div class="css-gr7s7g"><p class="rt-Text css-56tzch">Gotta have that pythonic journey to start • Learned how to perform web scraping while adhering to the robots.txt

Having gone through the bad experience of live demo failing in the traffic light project. The naive highschooler goes on to test the dustbin 50 times at home and fixing any kinks that happen and said dustbin works perfectly,
being proud of his accomplishments he does a video call with his teammates to show them the final result and even they are impressed, comes the day of the live demo and the dustbin fails.
I did all of the coding, which was mainly detecting if a hand is near the proximity sensor and then to keep the lid open otherwise close it after a few seconds, and most of the wiring in the project.
Yes I boasted about multithreading in this project too even though it really wasn&#x27;t.

copy pasting function calls in random spots in a while loop, and then boasting about how I made a &quot;multithreaded&quot; application even though arduino apparently only supports single threaded things.

• Team lead for both projects.
• Made sure that the team was able to work at its peak at all times.
• Gave motivation to teammates whenever they felt burnt out.
• Managed the full code base and took care of any merge conflicts during both projects.
• Did QA (Quality assurance) testing throughout the development of the games. Dogscape:
• Developed a 2D platformer where the main character is a dog that has to fight cats to reach the end of each level. Fostered
teamwork and collaboration among project members.
Chaotigator:
• Developed an infinitely generating platformer game where the main character is an alligator which has to survive disasters
