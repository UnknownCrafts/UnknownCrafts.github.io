* Optimized autonomous navigation software for the rover using ROS 2, focusing on robust and reliable operation in challenging environments.
* Implemented a sophisticated input multiplexer (mux) within ROS 2, prioritizing joystick (Logitech F710) then keyboard, and then ROS2 autonomous navigation commands to ensure seamless operator control and autonomous functionality.
    * Enabled kernel extensions to get full functionality of the Logitech F710 wireless controller on the NVIDIA Jetson Nano Orin, resolving compatibility issues and ensuring precise operator input.
* Optimized real-time camera stream transmission over wireless radio links (Ubiquiti BulletAC IP67) to maximize bandwidth utilization and minimize latency.
    * Conducted extensive empirical testing to determine optimal radio configurations, achieving improved data throughput and signal stability.
    * Analyzed Wi-Fi spectrum graphs to identify and mitigate channel congestion in 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands, ensuring reliable communication in noisy environments.
* Contributed to the design and implementation of ROS 2 nodes for sensor fusion and path planning, enhancing the rover's autonomous navigation capabilities.
* Utilized ROS2 launch files, and debugged ROS2 nodes using command line tools such as ros2 topic echo, and ros2 node info.
* Worked on streamlining the creation of ROS2 development VM (Virtual Machine) for M series macbooks.
